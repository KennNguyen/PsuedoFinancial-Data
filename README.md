# PseudoFinancial-Data

## Overview

**PseudoFinancial-Data** is a real-time simulation platform for generating, distributing, and analyzing synthetic financial market data using modern systems tools and realistic stochastic models. It is designed for quantitative finance research, strategy prototyping, market behavior analysis, and systems engineering training.

Built with performance in mind, the system integrates high-speed C++ simulations (factor and Heston models), FastAPI endpoints, real-time streaming via Kafka, in-memory caching via Redis, and scalable storage via PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB. A responsive frontend powered by S3 + CloudFront visualizes the output for inspection and educational purposes.

## ‚úÖ Stage One: C++ Simulation Core (Completed)

- **Factor Model (`factor_model.cpp`)**:  
  Simulates asset returns using a Gaussian single-factor model with asset-specific beta exposures and idiosyncratic shocks. Factor increments follow a random walk distribution.

- **Heston Model (`heston_model.cpp`)**:  
  Simulates asset prices using the Heston stochastic volatility model with correlation to the factor model's systemic shocks. Euler-Maruyama discretization is used, with variance clamping to ensure numerical stability.

---

## üöÄ Stage Two: Data Distribution + Real-Time Processing (Ongoing)

- **Kafka**:  
  Acts as the primary event stream pipeline, distributing tick-level data across consumers.

- **Redis**:  
  Caches the latest market data in memory for low-latency reads. Allows real-time web dashboards and backtesters to query the most recent data instantly.

---

## üß† Stage Three: Historical Storage (Ongoing)

- **PostgreSQL** (with **TimescaleDB**):  
  Stores long-term historical market simulations. Schema supports efficient querying via hypertables and time-based partitioning. Indexing strategies are under evaluation for large-scale multi-asset data retention.

---

## üî¨ Research-Oriented Modeling Approach

- **Data Generation**:
  - Simulate price and volatility using Heston dynamics with both systemic and idiosyncratic risk sources
  - Generate correlated factor returns for portfolio-wide behavior modeling
  - Use numerically stable and reproducible simulation methods in C++

- **Streaming + Caching**:
  - Publish tick-level price data using Kafka producers
  - Cache ‚Äúhot‚Äù symbols in Redis to simulate real-world data prioritization

- **Storage Design**:
  - Store cold data in TimescaleDB and CSV
  - Query via hypertables for efficient time-range slicing

- **Deployment**:
  - Static frontend hosted via **AWS S3 + CloudFront**
  - GitHub Actions auto-sync public files to S3 while excluding sensitive files like `.yml`
  - Bucket is secured with **OAC (Origin Access Control)** instead of public access
